# TRVL
Every holiday season, planning a vacation getaway seems more and more stressful. TRVL is a web application that enables users to plan their domestic trips with ease.

Built using MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, and Material UI

## MongtDB
MongoDB is used as the main database system of this project. This database holds the registered user's information as objects. 
These objects include their username, their bcrypted password, their itnierary, posts, and their profile picture.  
The MongoDB also holds all the different posts made the different users.

## Express
Express was used throught out the front and backend of the project inorder to maintain proper route handling between client and server side. 
It provides a set of features for developing web applications in Node.js, such as handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, and middleware.
Express is also making easy HTTP requests and API calls which allows us to get the data for our project from the YELP Fusion API.

## React
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library that is used for building the user interface of the website. React is responsible for most of the
front end development It also allows us to make reusable UI components that can be composed together to build complex user interfaces. In short, this declarative program 
allows us to make changes based on what we want the website to look at.

## Node.js
Node.js is responsible for most of our data calls as it's the first and main connection we implemented to our mongoDB. Node makes the backend database calls that is later used 
for frontend developement.

## Material UI
Material UI is a open source react-component library that is used for most of the designs within the website. Material UI was used to implement the individual events, 
categories, hotels, and restaurants. Mui Material was also used to make most of the search engines within the website. In short, Material UI a well-developed front-end library 
that was implemented to give our project the "website" material look.
